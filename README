python2board is intended to deploy a set of images to specific hosts. 

Run python2board with a configuration file to automatically deploy docker images to the intended hosts.

The configuration file uses a json format and should be an array of name, host, and a compose yaml file.

[{"name":"Sample", "host":"tcp://127.0.0.1:1234", "yaml":"~/Documents/docker-compose.yml"}]

As the sample shows, the host value should be the full network address of the host, port included.
If the host address does not correspond to an actually running docker daemon, the docker-compose 
command will fail for that host.

The yaml value should be generally be the full file path point to the compose yaml file. Alternatively,
if running from a known directory, it can be a relative path.
